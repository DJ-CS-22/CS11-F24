# Instructions
**Objective:** Explore where the pieces of the `for` loop expression comes from. 

## Background information 
There are two* primary forms of loops in programming, a `while` loop which repeats **while** a condition is `true` and a `for` loop which repeats **for** some predetermined number of iterations.

*There is also a `do while` loop but we don't talk about it.

## Instructions
### Part one: While loop
Write a program which contains a single `cout` statement.
```cpp
cout << "Hello world" << endl;
```
Use a `while` loop to output "Hello world" exactly 5 times.
You should end up with something similar to the program `solution_while.cpp`.

### Part two: For loop
Modify the last program to use a for loop instead. You should end up with something similar to the program `solution_for.cpp`. Notice how the pieces which make up the `for` loop expression are present in the `while` loop version.
