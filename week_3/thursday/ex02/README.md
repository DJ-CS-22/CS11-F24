# Instructions
**Objective:** Write a program which finds the smallest of three numbers

## Background information 
Calculating the minimum of three numbers is a fundamental part of a heap data structure which you will learn about in CS-21. 

## Instructions
1. Use a series of decision making statements to find the smallest value entered.
2. Output the result.


## Test Cases
### Case 1
```
Enter three numbers separated by spaces: 7 12 9
The minimum of 7, 12, and 9 is 7
```
### Case 2
```
Enter three numbers separated by spaces: 12 -2 -4
The minimum of 12, -2, and -4 is -4
```
